# ðŸŒŸ RAG with Astra DB

This guide will walk you through how to build a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) application using **Astra DB** and **Langflow**.

[Astra DB](https://www.datastax.com/products/datastax-astra?utm_source=langflow-pre-release&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langflow-announcement&utm_content=astradb) is a cloud-native database built on Apache Cassandra that is optimized for the cloud. It is a fully managed database-as-a-service that simplifies operations and reduces costs. Astra DB is built on the same technology that powers the largest Cassandra deployments in the world.

In this guide, we will use Astra DB as a vector store to store and retrieve the documents that will be used by the RAG application to generate responses.

<Admonition type="tip">
  This guide assumes that you have Langflow up and running. If you are new to
  Langflow, you can check out the [Getting
  Started](../getting-started/install-langflow.mdx) guide.

TLDR;

- [Create a free Astra DB account](https://astra.datastax.com/signup?utm_source=langflow-pre-release&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langflow-announcement&utm_content=create-a-free-astra-db-account)
- Duplicate our [Langflow 1.0 Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow-Preview?duplicate=true)
- Create a new database, get a **Token** and the **API Endpoint**
- Click on the **New Project** button and look for Vector Store RAG. This will create a new project with the necessary components
- Import the project into Langflow by dropping it on the Canvas or My Collection page
- Update the **Token** and **API Endpoint** in the **Astra DB** components
- Update the OpenAI API key in the **OpenAI** components
- Run the ingestion flow which is the one that uses the **Astra DB** component
- Click on the âš¡ _Run_ button and start interacting with your RAG application

# First things first

## Create an Astra DB Database

To get started, you will need to [create an Astra DB database](https://astra.datastax.com/signup?utm_source=langflow-pre-release&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=langflow-announcement&utm_content=create-an-astradb-database).

Once you have created an account, you will be taken to the Astra DB dashboard. Click on the **Create Database** button.

    light: "img/astra-create-database.png",
    dark: "img/astra-create-database.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

Now you will need to configure your database. Choose the **Serverless (Vector)** deployment type, and pick a Database name, provider and region.

After you have configured your database, click on the **Create Database** button.

  sources={{
    light: "img/astra-configure-deployment.png",
    dark: "img/astra-configure-deployment.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

Once your database is initialized, to the right of the page, you will see the _Database Details_ section which contains a button for you to copy the **API Endpoint** and another to generate a **Token**.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/astra-generate-token.png",
    dark: "img/astra-generate-token.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "50%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

Now we are all set to start building our RAG application using Astra DB and Langflow.

## (Optional) Duplicate the Langflow 1.0 HuggingFace Space

If you haven't already, now is the time to launch Langflow. To make things easier, you can duplicate our [Langflow 1.0 Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow-Preview?duplicate=true) which sets up a Langflow instance just for you.

## Open the Vector Store RAG Project in Langflow

Run Langflow and open the UI.

In the Langflow dashboard, click the **New Project** button and select the **Vector Store RAG** project. This will open a starter project with the necessary components to run a RAG application using Astra DB.

This project consists of two flows. The simpler one is the **Ingestion Flow** which is responsible for ingesting the documents into the Astra DB database.

Your first step should be to understand what each flow does and how they interact with each other.

The ingestion flow consists of:

- **Files** component that uploads a text file to Langflow
- **Recursive Character Text Splitter** component that splits the text into smaller chunks
- **OpenAIEmbeddings** component that generates embeddings for the text chunks
- **Astra DB** component that stores the text chunks in the Astra DB database

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/astra-ingestion-flow.png",
    dark: "img/astra-ingestion-flow.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

Now, let's update the **Astra DB** and **Astra DB Search** components with the **Token** and **API Endpoint** that we generated earlier, and the OpenAI Embeddings components with your OpenAI API key.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/astra-ingestion-fields.png",
    dark: "img/astra-ingestion-fields.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

And run it! This will ingest the Text data from your file into the Astra DB database.

<ZoomableImage

  sources={{
    light: "img/astra-ingestion-run.png",
    dark: "img/astra-ingestion-run.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

Now, on to the **RAG Flow**. This flow is responsible for generating responses to your queries. It will define all of the steps from getting the User's input to generating a response and displaying it in the Playground.

The RAG flow is a bit more complex. It consists of:

- **Chat Input** component that defines where to put the user input coming from the Playground
- **OpenAI Embeddings** component that generates embeddings from the user input
- **Astra DB Search** component that retrieves the most relevant Records from the Astra DB database
- **Text Output** component that turns the Records into Text by concatenating them and also displays it in the Playground
  - One interesting point you'll see here is that this component is named `Extracted Chunks`, and that is how it will appear in the Playground
- **Prompt** component that takes in the user input and the retrieved Records as text and builds a prompt for the OpenAI model
- **OpenAI** component that generates a response to the prompt
- **Chat Output** component that displays the response in the Playground

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/astra-rag-flow.png",
    dark: "img/astra-rag-flow.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

To run it all we have to do is click on the ðŸ¤– _Playground_ button and start interacting with your RAG application.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/astra-rag-flow-run.png",
    dark: "img/astra-rag-flow-run.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

This opens the Playground where you can chat your data.

Because this flow has a **Chat Input** and a **Text Output** component, the Panel displays a chat input at the bottom and the Extracted Chunks section on the left.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/astra-rag-flow-interaction-panel.png",
    dark: "img/astra-rag-flow-interaction-panel.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

Once we interact with it we get a response and the Extracted Chunks section is updated with the retrieved records.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/astra-rag-flow-interaction-panel-interaction.png",
    dark: "img/astra-rag-flow-interaction-panel-interaction.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

And that's it! You have successfully ran a RAG application using Astra DB and Langflow.
