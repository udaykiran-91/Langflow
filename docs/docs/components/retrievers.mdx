# Retrievers

A retriever is an interface that returns documents in response to an unstructured query. It's broader than a vector store because it doesn't need to store documents; it only needs to retrieve them.

## MultiQueryRetriever

The `MultiQueryRetriever` automates generating multiple queries, retrieves relevant documents for each query, and aggregates the results. This method improves retrieval effectiveness and addresses the limitations of traditional distance-based methods.

**Parameters**

- **LLM:** Specifies the language model used in the `MultiQueryRetriever`.
- **Prompt:** Defines a schema for the LLM.
- **Retriever:** Identifies the retriever that fetches documents.
- **parser_key:** Specifies the key or attribute name of the parsed output for retrieval. By default, it's set to `lines`, meaning the output from the language model is split into separate lines of text. This allows the retriever to fetch documents relevant to each line of text.
