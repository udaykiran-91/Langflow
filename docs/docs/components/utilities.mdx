## Unique ID generator

Generates a unique identifier (UUID) for each instance it is invoked, providing a distinct and reliable identifier suitable for a variety of applications.

**Parameters**

- **Value:** This field displays the generated unique identifier (UUID). The UUID is dynamically generated for each instance of the component, ensuring uniqueness across different uses.

**Output**

- Returns a unique identifier (UUID) as a string. This UUID is generated using Python's `uuid` module, ensuring that each identifier is unique and can be used as a reliable reference in your application.

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
  The Unique ID Generator is crucial for scenarios requiring distinct
  identifiers, such as session management, transaction tracking, or any context
  where different instances or entities must be uniquely identified. The
  generated UUID is provided as a hexadecimal string, offering a high level of
  uniqueness and security for identification purposes.
