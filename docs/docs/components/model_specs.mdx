# Large Language Models (LLMs)

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a foundational component of Langflow. It provides a uniform interface for interacting with LLMs from various providers, including OpenAI, Cohere, and HuggingFace. Langflow extensively uses LLMs across its chains and agents, employing them to generate text based on specific prompts or inputs.
