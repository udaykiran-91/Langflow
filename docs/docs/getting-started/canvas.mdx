# ðŸŽ¨ Langflow Canvas

The **Langflow canvas** is the central hub of Langflow, where you'll assemble new flows from components, run them, and see the results.

To get a feel for the canvas, we'll examine a basic prompting flow.
You can either build this flow yourself, or select **New Project** > **Basic prompting** to open a canvas with the flow pre-built.

## Flows, components, collections, and projects

A [flow](#flow) is a pipeline of components connected together in the Langflow canvas.

A [component](#component) is a single building block within a flow. A component has inputs, outputs, and parameters that define its functionality.

A [collection](#collection) is a snapshot of the flows available in your database. Collections can be downloaded to local storage and uploaded for future use.

A [project](#project) can be a component or a flow. Projects are saved as part of your collection.

For example, the **OpenAI LLM** is a **component** of the **Basic prompting** flow, and the **flow** is stored in a **collection**.

## Flow

A **flow** is a pipeline of components connected together in the Langflow canvas.

For example, the [Basic prompting](../starter-projects/basic-prompting.mdx) flow is a pipeline of four components:

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/basic-prompting.png",
    dark: "img/basic-prompting.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "800px", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

In this flow, the **OpenAI LLM component** receives input (left side) and produces output (right side) - in this case, receiving input from the **Chat Input** and **Prompt** components and producing output to the **Chat Output** component.

## Component

Components are the building blocks of flows. They consist of inputs, outputs, and parameters that define their functionality. These elements provide a convenient and straightforward way to compose LLM-based applications. Learn more about components and how they work in the LangChain [documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/components).

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
  During the flow creation process, you will notice handles (colored circles)
  attached to one or both sides of a component. These handles represent the
  availability to connect to other components. Hover over a handle to see
  connection details.
</div>

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
  For example, if you select a <code>ConversationChain</code> component, you
  will see orange <span style={{ color: "orange" }}>o</span> and purple{" "}
  <span style={{ color: "purple" }}>o</span> input handles. They indicate that
  this component accepts an LLM and a Memory component as inputs. The red
  asterisk <span style={{ color: "red" }}>*</span> means that at least one input
  of that type is required.
</div>

{" "}

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("img/single-component.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("img/single-component.png"),
  }}
  style={{ width: "40%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

<div style={{ marginBottom: "20px" }}>
In the top right corner of the component, you'll find the component status icon (![Status icon](/logos/playbutton.svg)).
Build the flow by clicking the **![Playground icon](/logos/botmessage.svg)Playground** at the bottom right of the canvas.

Once the validation is complete, the status of each validated component should turn green (![Status icon](/logos/greencheck.svg)).
To debug, hover over the component status to see the outputs.

</div>

### Component Parameters

Langflow components can be edited by clicking the component settings button. Hide parameters to reduce complexity and keep the canvas clean and intuitive for experimentation.

<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/langflow_parameters.mp4" />
</div>

### Component menu

Each component is a little unique, but they will all have a menu bar on top that looks something like this.
The menu options are **Code**, **Save**, **Duplicate**, and **More**.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/chat-input-with-menu.png",
    dark: "img/chat-input-with-menu.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "40%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

### Code menu

The **Code** button displays your component's Python code.
You can modify the code and save it.

#### Save

Save your component to the **Saved** components folder for re-use.

#### Duplicate

Duplicate your component in the canvas.

#### More

**Advanced** - modify the parameters of your component.

<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/langflow_parameters.mp4" />
</div>

**Copy** - copy your component.

**Share** - share your component to the Langflow store.

**Docs** - view documentation for your component.

**Delete** - delete your component.

### Group multiple components

Components without input or output nodes can be grouped into a single component for re-use.
This is useful for combining large flows into single components (like RAG with a vector database, for example) and saves space in the canvas.

1. Hold **Shift** and drag to select the **Prompt** and **OpenAI** components.
2. Select **Group**.
3. The components merge into a single component.
4. To save the new component, select **Save**. It can now be re-used from the **Saved** components folder.

## Playground

Run your flow by clicking the **![Playground icon](/logos/botmessage.svg)Playground** button.

For more, see [Playground](../administration/playground.mdx).

## API

The **API** button opens the API window, where Langflow presents code for integrating your flow into external applications.

Modify the call's parameters in the **Tweaks** window, click the **Copy Code** or **Download** buttons, and paste your code where you want to use it.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/api-window.png",
    dark: "img/api-window.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "60%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

### curl

The **curl** tab displays sample code for posting a query to your flow.
Modify the `input_value` to change your input message.
Copy the code and run it to post a query to your flow and get the result.

```curl
curl -X POST \
  http://127.0.0.1:7863/api/v1/run/f2eefd80-bb91-4190-9279-0d6ffafeaac4\?stream\=false \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
  -d '{"input_value": "is anybody there?",
  "output_type": "chat",
  "input_type": "chat",
  "tweaks": {
  "Prompt-uxBqP": {},
  "OpenAIModel-k39HS": {},
  "ChatOutput-njtka": {},
  "ChatInput-P3fgL": {}
}}'
```

Result:

```
{"session_id":"f2eefd80-bb91-4190-9279-0d6ffafeaac4:53856a772b8e1cfcb3dd2e71576b5215399e95bae318d3c02101c81b7c252da3","outputs":[{"inputs":{"input_value":"is anybody there?"},"outputs":[{"results":{"result":"Arrr, me hearties! Aye, this be Captain [Your Name] speakin'. What be ye needin', matey?"},"artifacts":{"message":"Arrr, me hearties! Aye, this be Captain [Your Name] speakin'. What be ye needin', matey?","sender":"Machine","sender_name":"AI"},"messages":[{"message":"Arrr, me hearties! Aye, this be Captain [Your Name] speakin'. What be ye needin', matey?","sender":"Machine","sender_name":"AI","component_id":"ChatOutput-njtka"}],"component_display_name":"Chat Output","component_id":"ChatOutput-njtka"}]}]}%
```

### Python API

The **Python API** tab displays code to interact with your flow using the Python HTTP requests library.

### Python Code

The **Python Code** tab displays code to interact with your flow's `.json` file using the Langflow runtime.

### Chat Widget HTML

The **Chat Widget HTML** tab displays code that can be inserted in the `<body>` of your HTML to interact with your flow.
For more, see the [Chat widget documentation](../administration/chat-widget.mdx).

### Tweaks

The **Tweaks** tab displays the available parameters for your flow.
Modifying the parameters changes the code parameters across all windows.
For example, changing the **Chat Input** component's `input_value` will change that value across all API calls.

<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/langflow_api.mp4" />
</div>

## Collection

A collection is a snapshot of flows available in a database.

Collections can be downloaded to local storage and uploaded for future use.

<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/langflow_collection.mp4" />
</div>

## Project

A **Project** can be a flow or a component. To view your saved projects, select **My Collection**.

Your **Projects** are displayed.

Click the **![Playground icon](/logos/botmessage.svg) Playground** button to run a flow from the **My Collection** screen.

In the top left corner of the screen are options for **Download Collection**, **Upload Collection**, and **New Project**.

Select **Download Collection** to save your project to your local machine. This downloads all flows and components as a `.json` file.

Select **Upload Collection** to upload a flow or component `.json` file from your local machine.

Select **New Project** to create a new project. In addition to a blank canvas, [starter projects](../starter-projects/basic-prompting.mdx) are also available.

## Project options menu

To see options for your project, in the upper left corner of the canvas, select the dropdown menu.

<ZoomableImage
