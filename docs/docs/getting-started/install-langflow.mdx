# üì¶ Install Langflow

<Admonition type="info">
  Langflow **requires** Python version 3.10 or greater.
</Admonition>

Langflow **requires** [Python >=3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) to be installed on your system.

Install Langflow with pip:

```bash
python -m pip install langflow -U
```

Install Langflow with pipx:

```bash
pipx install langflow --python python3.10 --fetch-missing-python
```

Pipx can fetch the missing Python version for you with `--fetch-missing-python`, but you can also install the Python version manually.

## Install Langflow pre-release

To install a pre-release version of Langflow:

pip:

```bash
python -m pip install langflow --pre --force-reinstall
```

pipx:

```bash
pipx install langflow --python python3.10 --fetch-missing-python --pip-args="--pre --force-reinstall"
```

Use `--force-reinstall` to ensure you have the latest version of Langflow and its dependencies.

## Having a problem?

If you encounter a problem, see [Common Installation Issues](/migration/possible-installation-issues).

To get help in the Langflow CLI:

```bash
python -m langflow --help
```

## ‚õìÔ∏è Run Langflow

1. To run Langflow, enter the following command.

```bash
python -m langflow run

2. Confirm that a local Langflow instance starts by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:7860` in a Chromium-based browser.

```bash

```

3. Continue on to the [Quickstart](./quickstart.mdx).

## HuggingFace Spaces

HuggingFace provides a great alternative for running Langflow in their Spaces environment. This means you can run Langflow without any local installation required.

In a Chromium-based browser, go to the [Langflow Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow?duplicate=true) or [Langflow v1.0 alpha Preview Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow-Preview?duplicate=true).

You'll be presented with the following screen:

<ZoomableImage

  sources={{
    light: "img/duplicate-space.png",
    dark: "img/duplicate-space.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "80%", maxWidth: "800px", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

Name your Space, define the visibility (Public or Private), and click on **Duplicate Space** to start the installation process. When installation is finished, you'll be redirected to the Space's main page to start using Langflow right away!
