# Pass

Sometimes all you need to do isâ€¦ nothing!

The **Pass** component enables you to ignore one input and move forward with another one. This is super helpful to swap routes for A/B testing!

<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/pass.mp4" />
</div>
