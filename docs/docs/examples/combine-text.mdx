# Combine Text

With LLM pipelines, combining text from different sources may be as important as splitting text.

The **Combine Text** component concatenates two text inputs into a single chunk using a specified delimiter, such as whitespace or a newline.

Also, check out **Combine Texts (Unsorted)** as a similar alternative.

This component is available under the **Helpers** tab of the Langflow preview.

<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/combine_text.mp4" />
</div>
