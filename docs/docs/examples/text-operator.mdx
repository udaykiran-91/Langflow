# Text Operator

The **Text Operator** component simplifies logic. It evaluates the results from another component (for example, if the input text exactly equals `Tuna`) and runs another component based on the results. Basically, the text operator is an if/else component for your flow.

<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/text_operator.mp4" />
</div>
