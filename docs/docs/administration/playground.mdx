# Playground

In Langflow 1.0 alpha, the **Playground** replaces the **Interaction Panel**.

The **Playground** provides an interface for interacting with flows without opening them in the flow editor.

It even works for flows hosted on the Langflow store!

As long as you have a flow's environment variables set, you can run it by clicking the **Playground** button.

1. From your **Collections** page, click the **![Playground icon](/logos/botmessage.svg)Playground** in one of your flows.
   The **Playground** window opens.

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("img/playground-chat.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("img/playground-chat.png"),
  }}
  style={{ width: "100%", maxWidth: "800px", margin: "0 auto" }}
/>

2. Chat with your bot as you normally would, all without having to open the editor.

<div
  style={{ marginBottom: "20px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}
>
  <ReactPlayer playing controls url="/videos/langflow_playground.mp4" />
</div>

## Playground I/O

The Playground's appearance changes depending on what components are in your canvas.

Adding or removing any of the below components modifies your Playground so you can monitor the inputs and outputs.

- Chat Input
- Text Input
- Chat Output
- Text Output
- Records Output
- Inspect Memory

You can also select **Options** > **Logs** to see your flow's logs.

For more information, see [Inputs and Outputs](../components/inputs-and-outputs.mdx).
