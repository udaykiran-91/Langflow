# ❗️ Common Installation Issues

This is a list of possible issues that you may encounter when installing Langflow 1.0 alpha and how to solve them.

## _`No module named 'langflow.__main__'`_

1. Run _`python -m langflow run`_ instead of _`langflow run`_.
2. If that doesn't work, reinstall Langflow with _`_python -m pip install langflow --pre -U`_.
3. If that doesn't work, reinstall Langflow and its dependencies with _`python -m pip install langflow --pre -U --force-reinstall`_.

When you try to run Langflow using the command `langflow run`, you may encounter the following error:

```bash
> langflow run
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File ".../langflow", line 5, in <module>
  from langflow.__main__ import main
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langflow.__main__'
```

There are two possible reasons for this error:

1. You've installed Langflow using _`pip install langflow`_ but you already had a previous version of Langflow installed in your system.
   In this case, you might be running the wrong executable.
   To solve this issue, run the correct executable by running _`python -m langflow run`_ instead of _`langflow run`_.
   If that doesn't work, try uninstalling and reinstalling Langflow with _`python -m pip install langflow --pre -U`_.
2. Some version conflicts might have occurred during the installation process.
   Run _`python -m pip install langflow --pre -U --force-reinstall`_ to reinstall Langflow and its dependencies.

## _`Something went wrong running migrations. Please, run 'langflow migration --fix'`_

Clear the cache by deleting the contents of the cache folder.

This folder can be found at:

- **Linux or WSL2 on Windows**: `home/<username>/.cache/langflow/`
- **MacOS**: `/Users/<username>/Library/Caches/langflow/`

This error can occur during Langflow upgrades when the new version can't override `langflow-pre.db` in `.cache/langflow/`. Clearing the cache removes this file but will also erase your settings.

If you wish to retain your files, back them up before clearing the folder.
