# Compatibility with Previous Versions

## TLDR;

- You'll need to add a few components to your flow to make it compatible with the new version of Langflow.
- Add a Runnable Executor, connect it to the last component (a Chain or an Agent) in your flow, and connect a Chat Input and a Chat Output to the Runnable Executor. This should work _most of the time_.
- You might also need to update the Chain or Agent component to the latest version.
- Most Components will work as they are, but you'll need to add an Input and an Output to your flow.
- You can use the Runnable Executor to run a LangChain runnable (which is the output of many components before 1.0)
- We need your feedback on this, so please let us know how it goes and what you think.

## Introduction

Langflow now works best with a flow that has an Input and an Output and that is mostly what you'll need to add to your existing flows.

Hopefully, you'll find that even though you still can work with your current flows, updating all your components to the new version of Langflow will be worth it.

We've tried to make it as easy as possible for you to adapt your existing flows to work seamlessly in the new version of Langflow.

## How to Adapt Your Existing Flows

The steps to take are few but not always simple. Here's how you can adapt your existing flows to work seamlessly in the new version of Langflow:

    While this should work most of the time, it might not work for all flows.
    You might need to update the Chain or Agent component to the latest version.

1. **Check if your flow ends with a Chain or Agent component**.
   - If it does not, it _should_ work as it is because it probably was not a chat flow.
2. **Add a Runnable Executor**.
   - Add a Runnable Executor to the end of your flow.
   - Connect the last component (a Chain or an Agent) in your flow to the Runnable Executor.
3. **Add a Chat Input and a Chat Output**.
   - Add a Chat Input and a Chat Output to your flow.
   - Connect the Chat Input to the Runnable Executor.
   - Connect the Chat Output to the Runnable Executor.
